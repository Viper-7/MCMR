Minecraft Mod Repository

A central repository for Minecraft mods, allows users to easily select any mods in the system to design a pack. 
The system automatically reconciles block/item IDs, includes dependencies, and checks for conflicting releases.
Mods can have as many versions in the repository as they like, with any one version being selected as "current"
Deployment is handled by a thin downloader application which will create a new vanilla launcher profile for the 
pack, then install forge and all mods and configs for the pack.
