Minecraft Mod Repository

A central repository for Minecraft mods, Designed to give users an easy way to create and deploy mod packs.
The system automatically reconciles block/item IDs, includes dependencies, and checks for conflicting releases.

Mods can have as many versions in the repository as they like, with any one version being selected as "current".

Deployment will be handled by a thin downloader application which creates a new vanilla launcher profile for the 
pack, then installs forge and all mods and required configs.
